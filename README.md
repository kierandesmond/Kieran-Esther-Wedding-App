# Summary
Based on a past wedding app I reacted for my Sister In-Laws wedding. This is a react-native app powered by firebase. Using a boilerplate template, its a custom app where people upload photos to your wedding app and they are all then in 1 place. It's about 2-3 days of work and could be updated in pinch to use.
This is a very quick example, as much of my work has been for companies and cannot be shared publically.




















### Boilerplate Features:

#### [Redux Persist](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist)
Allows you to save your Redux state locally on your device.
#### [Redux Persist Sensitive Storage](https://github.com/CodingZeal/redux-persist-sensitive-storage)
Utilizes Redux Persist to save sensitive information on the user's device, using the keychain service for iOS, and shared preferences for Android.
#### [Redux Persist Filesystem Storage](https://github.com/robwalkerco/redux-persist-filesystem-storage#readme)
By default, Redux Persist uses `asyncstorage` to save data, but there is a file size cap. Redux Persist Sensitive Storage uses the device's filesystem to persist data, instead of `asyncstorage` which gets around the file size limitation of `asyncstorage`.
