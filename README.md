#### [Redux Persist](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist)
Allows you to save your Redux state locally on your device.
#### [Redux Persist Sensitive Storage](https://github.com/CodingZeal/redux-persist-sensitive-storage)
Utilizes Redux Persist to save sensitive information on the user's device, using the keychain service for iOS, and shared preferences for Android.
#### [Redux Persist Filesystem Storage](https://github.com/robwalkerco/redux-persist-filesystem-storage#readme)
By default, Redux Persist uses `asyncstorage` to save data, but there is a file size cap. Redux Persist Sensitive Storage uses the device's filesystem to persist data, instead of `asyncstorage` which gets around the file size limitation of `asyncstorage`.
